Even though they only cook their burgers well done, the ingredients were incredibly fresh and juicy. The milkshake was thick and creamy, and was made with real, fresh, sweet strawberries.

And plain chicken wings- oozing with flavor and goes extremely well with their chili sauce and ketchup. Fries were decent but nohing to rave about.

The spring rolls were decent but the fried chicken was really interesting as you had to unwrap each individual piece of chicken before eating it.

For mains, after much deliberation, we chose Bintang curry - very different, never had anything like it, nasi goreng - standard indonesian dish that you can’t get wrong, pad thai noodles - these were a bit bland, and katsu chicken - delicious curry and lip smacking fried chicken! We also ordered sweet potato fries and wasabi slaw for sides, which was average but still pretty edible. The value was great, but do note that cards aren’t accepted.Verdict: Halal status confirmed on all meats\n#bintang #camden #london #foodgram #instafood #indonesian #asian #chicken #friedchicken #panasian #wings #delicious #halallondon #fatomar #thefatomarr #دجاج #طعام #لندن #حلال"},{"_id":"5a78ac4af36d281a9f5673f7","RestaurantName":"Masgouf","Review":"Masgouf is an iraqi restaurant chain in central London, specializing in arab food. The place looked plain, classy, and clean. I was seated relatively quickly by polite waiters. Lost in the various grills available. I decided to go for some hummus with meat for starters - chewy meat but delicious hummus. For the mains, I ordered a plate of Makhoos (chopped lamb cubes with minced lamb) and a potato stew with meat (both of which contained good quality but poorly seasoned meat), alongside a plate of rice. This place could be a gem for those with an aversion to spice.The food doesn’t come cheap but its of good quality. Verdict: 👍🏼Do give it a shot if you’re in the area.
