      <p class="lead">Creams is a dessert parlour with branches nationwide, serving up all kinds of mouth watering treats. The place itself is styled like a diner with a theme of black and purple. The menu is extensive and well sectioned, making it very hard to pick your sin. We decided to order a sweet shop bubble pop waffle and a kinder bueno cookie dough. The waffle was massive and smelled amazing! The bubblegum ice cream gave it a unique funky refreshing taste. The cookie dough was warm, soft and gooey on the inside, and went very well with the vanilla ice cream and the partially melted cookie dough.
